HEALTHCARE SIMULATOR

Healthcare simulator is a WPF App (.NET Framework) for simulating a healthcare system. This includes a database
of patient files, a list of doctors, a list of pharmacists, and a list of available medications (over-the
counter and prescription drugs). Patient files and doctors can be added and removed during run-time by
the user of the app.
Any patient in the system can visit any doctor and acquire prescriptions for any of the prescription
medications in the system. Patients can also visit the pharmacy, where they can purchase medications.
Over-the-counter medications can be purchased freely, but prescription medications can only be
purchased with the help of a pharmacist and with an appropriate prescription. Prescription refills are
kept track of on every prescription of every patient, and prescriptions can no longer be used once once
their refills reach 0.
